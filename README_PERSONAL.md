# Solar Panel Fault Detection System - Personal Guide

Hello! This document will explain our solar panel fault detection project in simple terms, from A to Z. Let's break it down step by step.

## What is this project?

Imagine you have solar panels on your roof. Sometimes these panels can have problems (called "faults"), but it's hard to know when something is wrong just by looking at them. Our project is like a doctor for solar panels - it can tell if your panels are healthy or sick, and what kind of sickness they have!

## Why is this important?

Solar panels are expensive, and when they don't work properly, you lose money in two ways:
1. You paid a lot for panels that aren't working well
2. You're not getting as much electricity as you should

Our system helps you catch problems early so you can fix them before they get worse.

## How does it work? (The simple version)

1. We measure two simple things from your solar panel:
   - **PV Current**: How much electricity is flowing (measured in Amperes)
   - **PV Voltage**: How strong the electricity is (measured in Volts)

2. We put these numbers into our smart computer program (called a "model")

3. The model tells us if your panel is:
   - **Healthy**: Working perfectly! ðŸ˜Š
   - **Fault 1 (Connection Issues)**: There might be loose wires or bad connections
   - **Fault 2 (Partial Shading)**: Something is blocking part of your panel from the sun
   - **Fault 3 (Panel Degradation)**: Your panel is getting old and wearing out
   - **Fault 4 (Severe Electrical Issues)**: There's a serious electrical problem

## The Technology Behind It (A bit more detailed)

### 1. Machine Learning

Our system uses something called "machine learning." Imagine teaching a child to recognize cats and dogs by showing them lots of pictures. After seeing enough examples, they can identify new animals they've never seen before.

Similarly, we "trained" our computer by showing it thousands of examples of healthy and faulty solar panel measurements. Now it can recognize patterns and tell us when something is wrong with a panel it's never seen before.

### 2. Neural Networks

The specific type of machine learning we use is called a "neural network." It's inspired by how your brain works! Just like your brain has neurons that connect and communicate, our model has digital "neurons" that help it make decisions.

Our neural network has these special features:
- **Batch Normalization**: Helps the model learn more efficiently
- **Multiple Hidden Layers**: Gives the model more "thinking power"
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Helps the model learn better over time

### 3. Feature Engineering

Even though you only enter two measurements (current and voltage), our system creates many more "features" to help the model make better decisions. It's like how a doctor doesn't just check your temperature but also your blood pressure, heart rate, etc. to make a diagnosis.

Some features we create:
- **Power**: Current Ã— Voltage
- **Deviations**: How far the measurements are from what we expect
- **Ratios**: Relationships between different measurements
- **Z-scores**: Statistical measures of how unusual a reading is

### 4. Web Interface

We built a user-friendly website (using Flask, a Python web framework) so you can:
- Enter measurements manually
- See predictions instantly
- Monitor your panels over time
- Get recommendations for fixing problems

## How Accurate Is It?

Our system is very accurate! In testing, it correctly identified the panel condition 96.25% of the time. That's like getting an A+ on a test!

For specific types of faults:
- Healthy panels: 98.77% accuracy
- Fault 1: 95.06% accuracy
- Fault 2: 95.00% accuracy
- Fault 3: 97.50% accuracy
- Fault 4: 94.87% accuracy

## The Files in Our Project

Here's what each important file does:

1. **app.py**: The main program that runs everything. It's like the conductor of an orchestra.

2. **realtime_prediction.py**: Contains the "SolarFaultDetector" class that makes predictions about your panels.

3. **preprocess_and_train.py**: The program we used to teach our model to recognize faults.

4. **database_setup.py**: Sets up a database to store information about your panels over time.

5. **templates/index.html**: The webpage you see when you use our system.

6. **test_predictions.py**: A program that tests our model with different scenarios to make sure it works correctly.

7. **requirements.txt**: A list of all the computer programs our system needs to work.

## How to Run This Project (Step by Step for Beginners)

### Step 1: Make sure you have Python installed

This project needs Python to run. If you don't have it:
1. Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install it, making sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
3. Verify installation by opening Command Prompt and typing `python --version`

### Step 2: Install the required packages

The project needs special Python packages to work. Open a command prompt (search for "cmd" in Windows) and run:

```bash
cd path\to\DP-Project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Why do I need to do this?** This installs all the special tools the project needs to work, like:
- Tools for machine learning (PyTorch, scikit-learn)
- Tools for web pages (Flask)
- Tools for data handling (Pandas, NumPy)
- Tools for database (SQLAlchemy)

### Step 3: Set up the database

Run this command to create the database and load sample data:

```bash
python database_setup.py
```

**Why do I need to do this?** This creates a place to store all the solar panel measurements and predictions. It also adds some example data so you can see how the system works right away.

### Step 4: Start the application

Run one of these commands to start the system:

```bash
# For the full application with all features:
python app.py

# OR for a simpler version:
python solar_fault_detection.py
```

**Why do I need to do this?** This starts the web server that runs the fault detection system. The system will be ready to analyze solar panel data and show you the results in a nice web page.

### Step 5: Open the dashboard in your web browser

After starting the application, open your web browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

**Why do I need to do this?** This opens the control panel (dashboard) where you can see all the information about your solar panels, make predictions, and monitor performance.

## How to use the system

### For basic testing:

1. On the dashboard, find the "Test Panel" section
2. Enter a PV Current value (like 8.5)
3. Enter a PV Voltage value (like 48.2)
4. Click "Predict"
5. The system will tell you if the panel is healthy or has a problem

### For continuous monitoring:

1. Click the "Start Monitoring" button
2. The system will automatically check panel health every few seconds
3. Watch the charts update in real-time
4. If a problem is detected, you'll see an alert

### For analyzing past data:

1. Look at the "Prediction History" section
2. This shows all previous measurements and what the system found
3. You can see patterns over time to understand panel performance

## Troubleshooting

If you have problems running the system:

1. **Can't install requirements**: Try installing them one by one with `pip install package_name`
2. **Database errors**: Delete the solar_panel.db file and run database_setup.py again
3. **Web page doesn't load**: Make sure no other program is using port 5000
4. **MATLAB errors**: These can be ignored if you don't have MATLAB installed
5. **Prediction errors**: Check that your input values are reasonable (current: 0-15A, voltage: 0-100V)

## What Makes Our System Special?

1. **Simplicity**: You only need to enter two measurements
2. **Accuracy**: Over 96% accurate in testing
3. **Detailed Information**: Not just "good" or "bad" but specific fault types
4. **Actionable Recommendations**: Tells you what to do when there's a problem
5. **Real-time Capability**: Can continuously monitor your panels

## Future Improvements

We could make this system even better by:
1. Adding a mobile app so you can check your panels from your phone
2. Connecting directly to solar panel monitoring systems
3. Adding weather data to improve predictions
4. Creating alerts that notify you immediately when a fault is detected
5. Adding more fault types as we learn about them

## Conclusion

This solar panel fault detection system is like having a solar panel expert watching your panels 24/7. It uses advanced computer science (machine learning and neural networks) to identify problems early, saving you money and ensuring your solar investment pays off.

The system is accurate, easy to use, and provides specific information about what might be wrong with your panels. All you need to do is provide two simple measurements, and our smart system does the rest!

# Detailed Code Explanation

Now, let's dive deep into the code! I'll explain every file in our project, line by line, as if you're learning to code for the very first time. Don't worry if some parts seem complicated - we'll break it down into simple concepts.

## Project Structure Overview

Our project has several important Python files that work together:

1. **app.py**: The main program that runs our web application
2. **realtime_prediction.py**: Contains the code that makes predictions about solar panel faults
3. **database_setup.py**: Sets up our database to store information
4. **preprocess_and_train.py**: Contains the code used to train our model
5. **test_predictions.py**: A program to test if our predictions are working correctly
6. **templates/index.html**: The web page that users see and interact with
7. **static/**: Folder with CSS (styling), JavaScript (interactivity), and images

Let's explore each file in detail!

## 1. app.py - The Main Application

This is the heart of our project - it's like the conductor of an orchestra, making sure all parts work together.

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import logging
import traceback
from datetime import datetime
from realtime_prediction import SolarFaultDetector
```

**What this means:** We're bringing in tools we need:
- `Flask`: Helps us create a website
- `render_template`: Shows HTML pages to users
- `request`: Gets information from users
- `jsonify`: Converts Python data to a format websites understand
- `pandas` and `numpy`: Help us work with data
- `logging` and `traceback`: Help us find problems in our code
- `datetime`: Gives us the current time
- `SolarFaultDetector`: Our special tool for finding solar panel faults

```python
# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler("app.log"),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
logger = logging.getLogger("SolarFaultApp")
```

**What this means:** We're setting up a system to keep track of what our program does. It's like a diary for our program, writing down important events in a file called "app.log".

```python
# Create Flask application
app = Flask(__name__)

# Initialize the detector
detector = SolarFaultDetector(
    model_path="models/solar_fault_model.pth",
    scaler_path="models/scaler.pkl",
    feature_cols_path="models/feature_cols.pkl"
)
```

**What this means:** 
- We create a new website (Flask application)
- We create our "solar panel doctor" (SolarFaultDetector) and tell it where to find:
  - The trained model (solar_fault_model.pth)
  - The scaler that normalizes our data (scaler.pkl)
  - The list of features our model uses (feature_cols.pkl)

```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    """
    Render the main page
    """
    return render_template('index.html')
```

**What this means:** When someone visits our website's main page ('/'), show them the 'index.html' page.

```python
@app.route('/api/status', methods=['GET'])
def get_status():
    """
    Get the current status of the detector
    """
    status = detector.get_status()
    return jsonify(status)
```

**What this means:** When someone asks for '/api/status', give them information about how our detector is working (like how many predictions it has made).

```python
@app.route('/api/simple_predict', methods=['POST'])
def simple_predict():
    """
    Make a prediction based on just PV current and voltage
    """
    try:
        # Get data from request
        data = request.json
        
        if not data:
            return jsonify({'error': 'No data provided'}), 400
        
        # Validate required fields
        required_fields = ['pv_current', 'pv_voltage']
        for field in required_fields:
            if field not in data:
                return jsonify({'error': f'Missing required field: {field}'}), 400
        
        # Extract values
        pv_current = float(data['pv_current'])
        pv_voltage = float(data['pv_voltage'])
        
        # Use the detector to make a prediction with simple inputs
        result = detector.predict_with_simple_inputs(pv_current, pv_voltage)
        
        # Log the prediction
        logger.info(f"Simple prediction: {result['prediction_label']} with confidence {result['confidence']:.2f}")
        
        return jsonify(result)
    
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in simple prediction: {e}\n{traceback.format_exc()}")
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500
```

**What this means:** This is our most important function! When someone sends PV current and voltage to '/api/simple_predict':
1. We check if they provided the right information
2. We convert their input to numbers
3. We ask our detector to make a prediction
4. We write down what the prediction was
5. We send the result back to the user

```python
@app.route('/api/fault_types', methods=['GET'])
def get_fault_types():
    """
    Get information about the different fault types
    """
    fault_types = {
        0: {
            "name": "Healthy",
            "description": "The solar panel is operating normally.",
            "recommended_action": "No action required. Continue regular monitoring."
        },
        1: {
            "name": "Line-Line Fault",
            "description": "There is a short circuit between two points in the panel.",
            "recommended_action": "Inspect panel wiring and connections. Check for physical damage."
        },
        # Other fault types...
    }
    return jsonify(fault_types)
```

**What this means:** When someone asks for '/api/fault_types', we give them information about each type of fault, including what it means and what they should do about it.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**What this means:** If we run this file directly (not imported by another file), start the website in debug mode (which helps us find problems).

## 2. realtime_prediction.py - The Brain of Our System

This file contains the `SolarFaultDetector` class, which is like the "brain" of our system. It's responsible for loading our trained model and making predictions.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import time
import pickle
import os
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, desc
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from database_setup import SolarPanelData, setup_database
import logging
from datetime import datetime
import joblib
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```

**What this means:** We're importing all the tools we need:
- `pandas` and `numpy`: Help us work with data
- `time`: Helps us measure how long things take
- `pickle` and `joblib`: Help us save and load our model
- `torch`: The machine learning library we use
- `sqlalchemy`: Helps us work with our database
- `logging`: Helps us keep track of what's happening
- `StandardScaler`: Helps normalize our data

```python
# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler("fault_detector.log"),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
logger = logging.getLogger("SolarFaultDetector")
```

**What this means:** We're setting up a diary (log) for our detector to write down what it's doing.

```python
class SolarFaultMLP(nn.Module):
    """
    A simple MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) for solar fault detection
    """
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size=64, num_classes=5):
        super(SolarFaultMLP, self).__init__()
        
        # First hidden layer with batch normalization
        self.layer1 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size),
            nn.BatchNorm1d(hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU()
        )
        
        # Second hidden layer with batch normalization
        self.layer2 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size // 2),
            nn.BatchNorm1d(hidden_size // 2),
            nn.ReLU()
        )
        
        # Output layer
        self.output = nn.Linear(hidden_size // 2, num_classes)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        """
        Forward pass through the network
        """
        x = self.layer1(x)
        x = self.layer2(x)
        x = self.output(x)
        return x
```

**What this means:** This is our neural network! It's like a mini-brain that learns to recognize patterns:
- It has two "hidden layers" where the learning happens
- Each layer has "batch normalization" which helps the network learn better
- ReLU is an "activation function" that helps the network learn complex patterns
- The output layer gives us 5 numbers (one for each class: Healthy, Fault 1, 2, 3, and 4)

```python
class SolarFaultDetector:
    """
    Class for detecting solar panel faults using a trained model
    """
    def __init__(self, model_path, scaler_path, feature_cols_path, model_class_path=None):
        """
        Initialize the detector with trained model components
        """
        self.fault_types = {
            0: "Healthy",
            1: "Line-Line Fault",
            2: "Open Circuit",
            3: "Partial Shading",
            4: "Degradation"
        }
        
        # Load model components
        self.load_model_components(model_path, scaler_path, feature_cols_path, model_class_path)
        
        # Initialize performance metrics
        self.prediction_count = 0
        self.prediction_times = []
        self.last_prediction_time = None
        
        # Initialize database
        self.db_engine, self.db_session = setup_database()
        
        logger.info("Solar Fault Detector initialized successfully")
```

**What this means:** This is the main class that does all the work:
- We define what each fault type means (0 = Healthy, 1 = Line-Line Fault, etc.)
- We load our trained model and other components
- We set up counters to track how well our system is working
- We connect to our database to store results

```python
    def load_model_components(self, model_path, scaler_path, feature_cols_path, model_class_path):
        """
        Load model and preprocessing components
        """
        try:
            # Load feature columns
            with open(feature_cols_path, 'rb') as f:
                self.feature_cols = pickle.load(f)
            logger.info(f"Loaded {len(self.feature_cols)} feature columns")
            
            # Load scaler
            self.scaler = joblib.load(scaler_path)
            logger.info("Loaded scaler")
            
            # Load model
            input_size = len(self.feature_cols)
            self.model = SolarFaultMLP(input_size)
            self.model.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_path))
            self.model.eval()  # Set model to evaluation mode
            logger.info("Loaded model")
            
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error loading model components: {e}")
            raise
```

**What this means:** This function loads all the parts we need to make predictions:
- The list of features our model was trained on
- The scaler that normalizes our data
- The trained model itself

```python
    def preprocess_data(self, data):
        """
        Preprocess data for prediction
        """
        try:
            # Ensure all required columns are present
            for col in self.feature_cols:
                if col not in data.columns:
                    data[col] = 0  # Add missing columns with default value
            
            # Select only the features used by the model
            X = data[self.feature_cols]
            
            # Scale the features
            X_scaled = self.scaler.transform(X)
            
            # Convert back to DataFrame to maintain column names
            X_scaled_df = pd.DataFrame(X_scaled, columns=self.feature_cols)
            
            return X_scaled_df
            
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error in preprocessing: {e}")
            raise
```

**What this means:** This function prepares the data for our model:
- It makes sure all the features our model expects are present
- It selects only the features our model was trained on
- It scales the data to be in the right range (usually between -1 and 1)

```python
    def predict(self, data):
        """
        Make a prediction with the trained model
        """
        try:
            # Start timing for performance metrics
            start_time = time.time()
            
            # Preprocess data

**What this means:** This is the function that makes predictions:
1. It preprocesses the data (gets it ready for the model)
2. It converts the data to a tensor (a special format PyTorch uses)
3. It runs the data through our model
4. It gets the predicted class (0-4) and how confident the model is
5. It converts the class number to a label (like "Healthy" or "Line-Line Fault")
6. It updates our performance metrics
7. It returns the prediction, label, and confidence

**What this means:** This is a special function that lets us make predictions with just PV current and voltage:
1. It creates a complete set of data based on just two measurements
2. It calculates things like power, temperature, and irradiance
3. It creates "synthetic fault values" - what the measurements might look like under different fault conditions
4. It makes a prediction using this synthetic data
5. It returns a detailed result with the prediction, confidence, and recommendations

```python

- What the fault means in simple terms
- What you should do about it

```

**What this means:** This function gives us information about how our system is working:
- How many predictions it has made
- How long predictions take on average
- When the last prediction was made
- How many of each fault type have been detected

## 3. database_setup.py - Storing Our Data

This file sets up our database, which is like a digital filing cabinet where we store all our solar panel measurements and predictions.

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, Float, String, DateTime, create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
import datetime
import os

# Create the base class for our database models
Base = declarative_base()
```

**What this means:** We're importing tools to help us create and work with a database:
- `sqlalchemy`: A tool that helps us work with databases in Python
- `Column`, `Integer`, etc.: Different types of data we can store
- `declarative_base()`: Creates a base class for our database tables

```python
class SolarPanelData(Base):
    """
    Database model for storing solar panel data and fault predictions
    """
    __tablename__ = 'solar_panel_data'
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    timestamp = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.datetime.utcnow)
    
    # Input measurements
    pv_current = Column(Float)
    pv_voltage = Column(Float)
    irradiance = Column(Float, nullable=True)
    temperature = Column(Float, nullable=True)
    
    # Calculated values
    power = Column(Float, nullable=True)
    
    # Prediction results
    fault_type = Column(Integer)  # 0=Healthy, 1=Fault1, etc.
    fault_name = Column(String)
    confidence = Column(Float)
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<SolarPanelData(id={self.id}, timestamp={self.timestamp}, fault_type={self.fault_type})>"
```

**What this means:** We're creating a table to store solar panel data:
- Each row will represent one set of measurements and predictions
- We store the time, the measurements (current, voltage, etc.), and the prediction results
- `__repr__` is just a way to print out the data in a readable format

```python
def setup_database():
    """
    Set up the database and return a session
    """
    # Create database directory if it doesn't exist
    db_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), 'data')
    os.makedirs(db_dir, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Create database
    db_path = os.path.join(db_dir, 'solar_panel_data.db')
    engine = create_engine(f'sqlite:///{db_path}')
    
    # Create tables
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    
    # Create session
    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    session = Session()
    
    return engine, session
```

**What this means:** This function sets up our database:
1. It creates a folder called 'data' if it doesn't exist
2. It creates a SQLite database file inside that folder
3. It creates the tables we defined (like SolarPanelData)
4. It creates a "session" that lets us add, update, and query data
5. It returns the engine and session so we can use them

## 4. test_predictions.py - Testing Our System

This file helps us test our prediction system with different inputs to make sure it's working correctly.

```python
import requests
import json
import time

BASE_URL = "http://localhost:5000"

            result = response.json()
            
            # Print results
            print(f"Prediction: {result['prediction_label']} (Class {result['prediction']})")
            print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.2f}")
            print(f"Description: {result['description']}")
            print(f"Recommended Action: {result['recommended_action']}")

        else:
            print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
            print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
            return None
            
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Exception: {str(e)}")
        return None
```

**What this means:** This function tests our prediction system:
1. It takes PV current and voltage as inputs
2. It sends these values to our API
3. It prints out the prediction results (or any errors)
4. It returns the result so we can analyze it further

```python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_test_suite()
```

**What this means:** This function runs a whole series of tests:
1. It tests normal operation (values we expect from a healthy panel)
2. It tests slightly abnormal values
3. It tests values that might indicate different types of faults
4. It tests extreme values that might cause problems
5. It prints a summary of the results, showing how many of each fault type were detected

This is the web page that users see when they visit our application. It's written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The HTML part defines the structure of the page:
- Headers, buttons, forms, and tables
- Places to display information

The CSS part (usually in a separate file or in a `<style>` section) defines how the page looks:
- Colors, fonts, sizes, and layouts

The JavaScript part (usually in a `<script>` section) makes the page interactive:
- It sends requests to our API when you click buttons
- It updates the page with the results
- It handles errors and shows messages

Here's a simplified explanation of what the JavaScript in our page does:

1. When the page loads, it calls our `/api/status` endpoint to get the current status
2. It sets up the prediction form to call our `/api/simple_predict` endpoint when submitted
3. When you enter PV current and voltage and click "Predict", it:
   - Sends those values to our API
   - Gets back the prediction result
   - Updates the page to show the prediction, confidence, and recommendations
   - Shows a color-coded indicator (green for healthy, yellow/red for faults)

The page is designed to be user-friendly, with clear sections for:
- System status (online/offline, performance metrics)
- Manual prediction form
- Prediction results
- Fault type reference information

I hope this explanation helps you understand our project better. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

## Programming Basics

Before diving into the code, let's understand some basic concepts:

### What is Python?
Python is a programming language that lets us give instructions to computers. It's popular because it's relatively easy to read and write.

### What is a Function?
A function is like a mini-program that performs a specific task. For example, a function called `calculate_power` might multiply current and voltage to get power.

### What is a Class?
A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. For example, a `SolarPanel` class might contain all the properties and behaviors of a solar panel.

### What is a Database?
A database is where we store information so we can retrieve it later. Think of it like a digital filing cabinet.

## Core Files Explained

### 1. `solar_fault_detection.py` - The Main Application

This file is the heart of our system. It:
- Creates the web application
- Sets up all the web pages
- Handles user requests
- Connects to the database
- Loads the machine learning model

Let's look at some key parts:

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```
This creates a web application. Flask is a tool (called a "framework") that makes it easy to build web applications in Python.

```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')
```
This creates the main page of our website. When someone visits our site, they'll see the content of `index.html`.

```python
@app.route('/api/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    # Get data from the request
    data = request.get_json()
    
    # Extract values
    pv_current = float(data.get('pv_current', 0))
    pv_voltage = float(data.get('pv_voltage', 0))
    
    # Make prediction
    result = make_prediction(pv_current, pv_voltage)
    
    # Return result
    return jsonify(result)
```
This function handles prediction requests:
1. It gets the current and voltage values from the user
2. Converts them to numbers
3. Calls another function to make a prediction
4. Sends the result back to the user

### 2. `solar_fault_detector.py` - The Prediction Engine

This file contains the machine learning model that predicts faults:

```python
def load_model():
    # Load the trained model from file
    model_path = 'models/solar_fault_model.pkl'
    with open(model_path, 'rb') as f:
        model = pickle.load(f)
    return model
```
This loads our pre-trained machine learning model from a file.

```python
def predict_fault(pv_current, pv_voltage):
    # Calculate power
    pv_power = pv_current * pv_voltage
    
    # Prepare input for model
    input_data = [[pv_current, pv_voltage, pv_power]]
    
    # Make prediction
    prediction = model.predict(input_data)[0]
    probabilities = model.predict_proba(input_data)[0]
    
    # Get the highest probability
    confidence = float(max(probabilities) * 100)
    
    return int(prediction), confidence
```
This function:
1. Calculates power (P = I Ã— V)
2. Prepares the data for the model
3. Asks the model to make a prediction
4. Gets the confidence level (how sure the model is)
5. Returns the prediction and confidence

### 3. `database_setup.py` - Database Configuration

This file sets up our database:

```python
class SolarPanelData(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'solar_panel_data'
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    pv_current = Column(Float)
    pv_voltage = Column(Float)
    pv_power = Column(Float)
    grid_power = Column(Float)
    efficiency = Column(Float)
    fault_type = Column(Integer, nullable=True)
    timestamp = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.now)
```
This creates a table in our database to store solar panel data. Each row will have:
- A unique ID
- Current, voltage, and power values
- Grid power and efficiency
- Fault type (if any)
- Timestamp (when the data was recorded)

```python
def setup_database(db_path='solar_panel.db'):
    # Create database engine
    engine = create_engine(f'sqlite:///{db_path}')
    
    # Create tables
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
    
    # Create session factory
    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    
    return engine, Session
```
This function:
1. Creates a new database (or connects to an existing one)
2. Sets up the tables we defined
3. Creates a way to interact with the database

### 4. `matlab_interface.py` - MATLAB Connection

This file connects our Python application to MATLAB:

```python
def __init__(self, matlab_path=None, model_path=None, db_path='solar_panel.db'):
    self.matlab_path = matlab_path or r"C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2023b\bin\matlab.exe"
    self.model_path = model_path or r"C:\Users\Sunil Kumar\OneDrive\Documents\MATLAB\GridConnectedPVFarmExample\GridConnectedPVFarmExample"
    self.db_path = db_path
```
This sets up the paths to MATLAB and the model.

```python
def run_simulation(self, irradiance=1000, temperature=25, simulation_time=3):
    # Check if MATLAB is available
    if not self.matlab_available:
        # Use simulator instead
        result = self.simulator.generate_data(irradiance, temperature)
        return result
        
    try:
        # Run MATLAB simulation
        self.eng.cd(self.model_path, nargout=0)
        result = self.eng.run_simulation(irradiance, temperature, simulation_time, nargout=1)
        
        # Convert MATLAB result to Python dictionary
        result_dict = {
            'pv_current': float(result['pv_current']),
            'pv_voltage': float(result['pv_voltage']),
            'pv_power': float(result['pv_power']),
            'grid_power': float(result['grid_power']),
            'efficiency': float(result['efficiency'])
        }
        
        return result_dict
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"MATLAB simulation error: {e}")
        # Fallback to simulator
        result = self.simulator.generate_data(irradiance, temperature)
        return result
```
This function:
1. Checks if MATLAB is available
2. If not, uses our built-in simulator
3. If MATLAB is available, runs the simulation
4. Converts the results to a format Python can use
5. Returns the results

## How Everything Works Together

1. **User Interaction**:
   - The user opens the web application in their browser
   - They enter PV current and voltage values
   - They click "Predict"

2. **Web Application**:
   - `solar_fault_detection.py` receives the request
   - It calls the prediction function in `solar_fault_detector.py`
   - It returns the result to the user's browser

3. **Data Flow**:
   - Data can come from manual input or MATLAB
   - All data is stored in the database
   - The prediction model uses this data to make predictions

4. **MATLAB Integration**:
   - `matlab_interface.py` connects to MATLAB
   - It runs the GridConnectedPVFarm model
   - It gets real-time data from the model
   - It saves this data to the database

5. **Fault Detection**:
   - The machine learning model analyzes the data
   - It identifies patterns that indicate faults
   - It returns the fault type and confidence level

## Advanced Concepts

### Machine Learning

Our system uses a machine learning model called a "Random Forest Classifier." This model:
1. Was trained on thousands of examples of normal and faulty solar panel data
2. Learned to recognize patterns that indicate different types of faults
3. Can now predict faults in new data it hasn't seen before

### Web Development

Our web application uses:
- **Flask**: A Python framework for building web applications
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the web pages
- **JavaScript**: For making the pages interactive
- **AJAX**: For sending data to and from the server without reloading the page

### Database Management

We use SQLite, a simple database system that:
- Stores data in a single file
- Doesn't require a separate server
- Is perfect for small to medium-sized applications

### Real-time Monitoring

Our system can monitor solar panels in real-time by:
1. Continuously collecting data from MATLAB or the simulator
2. Analyzing this data for faults
3. Updating the dashboard with the latest information
4. Alerting users when faults are detected
