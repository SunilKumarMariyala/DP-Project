## 1. Basic Programming Concepts

### What is Programming?
Programming is giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks. Think of it like writing a recipe - you're telling the computer exactly what to do, step by step.

### Variables
Variables are like labeled containers that store information. For example:
```python
pv_current = 8.0  # This creates a container labeled "pv_current" and puts the value 8.0 in it
```

When we write `pv_current = 8.0`, we're saying "create a container called pv_current and put the value 8.0 in it."

### Data Types
Different kinds of information are stored as different "types":
- **Integers (int)**: Whole numbers like 1, 42, -7
- **Floating-point (float)**: Numbers with decimal points like 3.14, 0.5
- **Strings (str)**: Text, written inside quotes like "Hello" or 'world'
- **Booleans (bool)**: True or False values
- **Lists**: Collections of items in order, like [1, 2, 3]
- **Dictionaries**: Collections of key-value pairs, like {"name": "John", "age": 30}

### Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They're like mini-programs within your program:

```python
def calculate_power(current, voltage):
    """Calculate electrical power"""
    return current * voltage

# Using the function
power = calculate_power(8.0, 30.0)  # power will be 240.0
```

The parts of a function:
- `def`: Tells Python we're defining a function
- `calculate_power`: The name of our function
- `(current, voltage)`: The inputs (parameters) our function needs
- `return current * voltage`: What the function gives back (returns)

### Control Flow
Control flow determines which parts of your code run based on certain conditions:

#### If-Else Statements
```python
if pv_current < 0.5:
    print("Low current detected!")
elif pv_current > 10.0:
    print("High current detected!")
else:
    print("Current is normal")
```

#### Loops
Loops repeat code multiple times:

```python
# For loop - repeat for each item in a collection
for reading in solar_readings:
    process_reading(reading)

# While loop - repeat as long as a condition is true
while monitoring_active:
    take_reading()
    time.sleep(1)  # Wait 1 second
```

## 2. Python Fundamentals

### Importing Libraries
Libraries are collections of pre-written code that we can use. We import them like this:

```python
import pandas as pd  # Import pandas and nickname it 'pd'
from flask import Flask  # Import just the Flask part from the flask library
```

### Classes and Objects
Classes are like blueprints for creating objects. Objects are things that have properties (attributes) and can do things (methods):

```python
class SolarPanel:
    def __init__(self, id, capacity):
        self.id = id
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.is_active = True
    
    def generate_power(self, sunlight_intensity):
        if not self.is_active:
            return 0
        return self.capacity * sunlight_intensity * 0.85  # 85% efficiency

# Create a solar panel object
my_panel = SolarPanel(id="Panel-A", capacity=300)  # 300W panel
power_output = my_panel.generate_power(sunlight_intensity=0.7)
```

## 3. Data Handling

### Pandas for Data Analysis
We use a library called Pandas to work with data in tables (DataFrames):

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
data = {
    'timestamp': ['2023-01-01 10:00', '2023-01-01 10:05'],
    'pv_current': [5.2, 5.4],
    'pv_voltage': [30.1, 29.8]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate power
df['pv_power'] = df['pv_current'] * df['pv_voltage']

# Filter data
high_power = df[df['pv_power'] > 150]
```

### NumPy for Numerical Operations
NumPy helps us work with numbers efficiently:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array of values
currents = np.array([5.2, 5.4, 5.1, 5.3, 5.0])

# Calculate statistics
average_current = np.mean(currents)  # 5.2
max_current = np.max(currents)  # 5.4
```

## 4. Database Systems

### What is a Database?
A database is like a super-organized filing cabinet for your data. It stores information in a structured way and makes it easy to find and update.

### MySQL
Our project uses MySQL as its database system. Here's how we interact with it:

```python
import mysql.connector

# Connect to the database
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(
    user='username',
    password='password',
    host='127.0.0.1',
    database='solar_panel_db'
)

# Create a cursor object
cursor = cnx.cursor()

# Execute a query
query = ("SELECT * FROM solar_panel_data")
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch the results
results = cursor.fetchall()

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
cnx.close()
```

### MySQL and Python
We use the `mysql-connector-python` library to connect to our MySQL database from Python.

### MySQL vs SQLite
Our project originally used SQLite but now uses MySQL. Here's the difference:

**SQLite**:
- Like a simple notebook - good for one person to use
- Stored in a single file on your computer
- Easy to set up, no separate server needed
- Not good for multiple users at once

**MySQL**:
- Like a professional filing system - good for many people to use
- Runs as a separate server program
- More powerful and faster with large amounts of data
- Better for web applications and multiple users

## 5. Web Development

### Flask Web Framework
We use Flask to create a web interface for our system:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/api/data')
def get_data():
    # Get the latest readings from the database
    latest_data = get_latest_readings()
    return jsonify(latest_data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=8080)
```

### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **HTML**: Creates the structure of web pages
- **CSS**: Makes the pages look nice
- **JavaScript**: Makes the pages interactive

## 6. Machine Learning

### What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is teaching computers to learn patterns from data, rather than explicitly programming them with rules.

### Our Neural Network Model
We use a neural network to detect solar panel faults:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SolarFaultMLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size=64, num_classes=5):
        super(SolarFaultMLP, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.layer3 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.layer1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.layer2(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.layer3(x)
        return x
```

### How Our Model Works
1. We feed in features like current, voltage, power, and their deviations
2. The model processes these through its layers
3. It outputs a prediction (0-4) for the panel's condition:
   - 0: Healthy
   - 1: Line-Line Fault
   - 2: Open Circuit
   - 3: Partial Shading
   - 4: Panel Degradation

## 7. MATLAB Integration

### What is MATLAB?
MATLAB is a special software for scientific computing, especially good at simulating physical systems like solar panels.

### How We Connect to MATLAB
We use the MATLAB Engine for Python to connect our system with MATLAB:

```python
import matlab.engine

# Start MATLAB
eng = matlab.engine.start_matlab()

# Run a MATLAB function
result = eng.run_simulation(nargout=1)

# Convert MATLAB result to Python
pv_current = float(result['pv_current'])
pv_voltage = float(result['pv_voltage'])
```

### MySQL and MATLAB Integration
Our new MySQL database makes it easier to exchange data with MATLAB:

```python
# In MATLAB:
conn = database('solar_panel_db', 'username', 'password', ...
    'Vendor', 'MySQL', ...
    'Server', 'localhost');

data = select(conn, 'SELECT * FROM solar_panel_data LIMIT 10');
```

## 8. Project-Specific Concepts

### Solar Panel Basics
- **PV Current**: The flow of electricity from the panel (measured in Amperes)
- **PV Voltage**: The electrical pressure from the panel (measured in Volts)
- **PV Power**: How much energy the panel produces (measured in Watts)
  - Power = Current Ã— Voltage

### Fault Detection Process
1. **Data Collection**: Get readings from sensors or MATLAB simulation
2. **Feature Engineering**: Calculate derived features like power and deviations
3. **Normalization**: Scale features to be in a similar range
4. **Prediction**: Run the data through our neural network
5. **Interpretation**: Convert the model's output to a human-readable result
6. **Storage**: Save the readings and predictions to the MySQL database
7. **Alerting**: Notify users if a fault is detected

### Common Test Cases
- **Healthy Panel**: PV Current: 8.0A, PV Voltage: 30.0V
  - Power: 240W, Prediction: Healthy (Class 0)
- **Line-Line Fault**: PV Current: 12.0A, PV Voltage: 15.0V
  - Power: 180W, Prediction: Line-Line Fault (Class 1)
- **Open Circuit**: PV Current: 0.0A, PV Voltage: 40.0V
  - Power: 0W, Prediction: Open Circuit (Class 2)
- **Partial Shading**: PV Current: 4.0A, PV Voltage: 28.0V
  - Power: 112W, Prediction: Partial Shading (Class 3)
- **Panel Degradation**: PV Current: 6.0A, PV Voltage: 25.0V
  - Power: 150W, Prediction: Panel Degradation (Class 4)
